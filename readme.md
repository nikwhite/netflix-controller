# Netflix Controller #
Control your Netflix instance running in Chrome from any device attached to your LAN.

## Setup 

Follow these instructions on your Netflix machine.

### Requirements  

* A machine to run Netflix on
	* Node.js 0.12.0+
	* Google Chrome 40+
	* _(Recommended)_ A static LAN IP
* A remote device connected to your LAN to use as the controller (e.g. smartphone, tablet)
	* A modern, evergreen browser

### Installation 

Get the Chrome extension:

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/netflix-controller/ofhdolemnemaefpickkjhhboccimhkjc

Clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/nikwhite/netflix-controller.git
```

Install npm packages from the root of the git repo:

```bash
$ npm install 
```

Start the node application from the same directory:

```bash
$ node index
```

This starts a node application. During startup it will print out your LAN IP and the port the application runs on (e.g. `192.168.1.2:8889`). This will be where you point your remote device to control Netflix.

## Usage 

Start Netflix on the host machine with the above installation steps completed. Point your remote device's web browser to the `IP:port` printed out by the node application. Search, browse, play, and enjoy!
